# StreamPay - React component
The folder structure for integrating StreamPay into a React-based storefront.

The folder structure for integrating StreamPay into a React-based storefront can vary based on your specific project setup and preferences. However, here is a general folder structure that you can follow:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Checkout/
│   │   ├── CheckoutForm.js
│   │   └── StreamPayButton.js
│   ├── Cart/
│   │   ├── CartItem.js
│   │   └── CartTotal.js
│   └── ...
├── pages/
│   ├── Home.js
│   ├── Shop.js
│   ├── Cart.js
│   └── Checkout.js
├── services/
│   ├── api.js
│   ├── cart.js
│   ├── payment.js
│   └── ...
├── utils/
│   ├── formatCurrency.js
│   ├── validateForm.js
│   └── ...
└── App.js
```

###€ Explanation of the folder structure:

- `components/`: This directory contains reusable components used throughout the application. For example, the `Checkout` folder may contain components related to the checkout process, including the `CheckoutForm` component for rendering the form fields and the `StreamPayButton` component for the StreamPay integration.

- `pages/`: This directory contains the page components of your application. Each page represents a different route or view. For example, the `Cart.js` component represents the cart page, and the `Checkout.js` component represents the checkout page.

- `services/`: This directory contains service modules responsible for handling API requests, managing the cart state, handling payment-related operations, and more. These services can be used by different components throughout the application.

- `utils/`: This directory contains utility modules or helper functions that provide common functionalities used across the application. For example, the `formatCurrency` module can provide formatting functions for currencies, and the `validateForm` module can contain form validation functions.

- `App.js`: This is the entry point of your application where you define the overall structure and routing of your app. It can contain the main router and the layout components.

Note that this is just a basic example, and your actual folder structure may vary depending on the complexity and requirements of your project. It's essential to organize your code in a way that makes sense for your specific application.
